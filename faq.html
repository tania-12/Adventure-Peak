            Adventure Peak is a fun, moderately competitive summer camp located in the Adirondack Mountains. We aim to provide 8-17 year olds with
            fun and engaging activities, while also providing leadership opportunities, social and emotional learning, survival skills, and most importantly,
            lifelong memories!

        <p class="faq-text">
          Yes, Adventure Peak is a sleepaway camp. We ask that you please keep your child 
          at camp for the entire duration of the program that they were signed up for.

        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Depending on which program your child is signed up for, your child will be at camp for either 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks.
          We have a full, fleshed-out curriculum for every part of the day, hence why we strongly ask that your child remain enrolled in
          camp for the entire time.

        <p class="faq-text">
          Because of our heavy enrollment numbers, we ask that you only submit an enrollment form if you know your child will be
          available for the entire program, or consider enrolling in our shorter programs.. We generally do not accommodate requests 
          for early dismissal from camp. In the event of an emergency, please contact our office at (xxx)xxx-xxxx

        <h3 class="faq-title">
          What if my child gets homesick?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Surprisingly enough, we've found that children generally do not feel overwhelmingly homesick. While the occasional homesickness
          is fairly common, it is a completely normal and natural feeling. Our camp counselors are highly trained in child care and will 
          connect with your child to ensure they feel at home. If you're worried about your child and want to stay in touch, we highly 
          encourage sending letters to our very special Parent Inbox, located at our facility. We've found that staying in contact with 
          your child has boosted morale and makes campers feel more at-ease knowing that their families are thinking about them!

          What is your policy on technology?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          Cell phones, laptops, and any device capable of communication is strictly prohibited. We understand that campers may want to stay in
          touch with family, and we have designated times throughout the week to write letters back home. We also do not permit cameras or other
          devices capable of taking pictures or videos to protect your child, as well as others. We do allow MP3 players and headphones, so long
          as they do not violate the policies above. Any devices that violate the technology agreement will be confiscated and will be returned on
          the <b>last day of camp.</b>

            What should my child bring?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
            We ask that parents provide their child with enough clothing to last for a week. Camp shirts and sweaters are covered with your child's 
            tuition, but we still ask that you bring a few articles of clothing so that your child has a choice in what to wear. We do not provide 
            toothbrushes, so please make sure to have your child bring one. If your child has any special items, such as toys, journals, books, etc.,
            we highly encourage bringing that so that your child can practice their hobbies during free time.

            Our camp shop will have anythign that your child may need should there be an accident, such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner,
            as well as souvenirs. Since we have a good balance between boys and girls, if your child is a girl, she will NOT be expected to purchase feminine
            products.

        <h3 class="faq-title">You mentioned that Adventure Peak has a camp shop. Should my child bring money?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
            Older campers are set up with a "Camper Account" so that they can make purchases as needed. You can reload their balance straight from home if you see that
            your child is low on funds. We do this to avoid physical cash being lost or stolen on the premesis. We also do not take credit or debit cards.
