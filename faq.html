                        Yes, Adventure Peak is a sleepaway camp. We ask that you please keep your child
                        at camp for the entire duration of the program that they were signed up for.

                    <p class="faq-text">
                        Because of our heavy enrollment numbers, we ask that you only submit an enrollment form if you know your child will be
                        available for the entire program. We generally do not accommodate requests for shorter program durations. In the event 
                        of an emergency, please contact our office at (xxx)xxx-xxxx.

                    <p class="faq-text">
                       Surprisingly enough, we've found that children generally do not feel overwhelmingly homesick. While the occasional homesickness
                       is fairly common, it is a completely normal and natural feeling. Our camp counselors are highly trained in child care and will 
                       connect with your child to ensure they feel at home. If you're worried about your child and want to stay in touch, we highly 
                       encourage sending letters to our very special Parent Inbox, located at our facility. We've found that staying in contact with 
                       your child has boosted morale and makes campers feel more at-ease knowing that their families are thinking about them!
