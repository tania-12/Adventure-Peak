            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p style = "text-align:left;">At Adventure Peak, we aim to provide children with a fun and exciting summer, and allow them to grow and develop their talents and skills. 
                    Our program is designed for children between the ages of 8 and 17, with choices between our 6-week, 8-week, and 12-week programming. Our campers are divided by age group (8-10,
                    11-13, 14-15, and 16-17) so that they can build connections with other campers close in age. We offer programs for all campers such as 
                    swimming, fishing, canoeing, whittling, arts and crafts, theater, dance, archery, sports, and more! Additionally, we offer special classes and certifications <b>exclusively to our 16-18 year olds</b>,
                    such as CPR, First Aid, and our new Counselor-in-Training program.
                </p>
